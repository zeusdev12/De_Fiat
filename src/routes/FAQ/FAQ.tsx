            question="What is DeFiat?"
            answer="DeFiat is a new approach to Decentralized Finance, commonly known as DeFi, by offering 
              non-custodial, decentralized financial services that are powered by DeFiat (DFT) Tokens.
              DeFiat's unique smart contract ecosystem creates economic incentives to hold and stake the token,
              while providing an extendable platform to build DeFi services on top of.
              Deflationary features of the DFT token work to reward token stakers through transaction fees and burns,
              creating a sustainable economic model. DeFiat includes fully embedded governance, where the token holders
              are granted voting power to decide on the direction of the platform based on their network share."

            question="What is the DeFiat Token (DFT)?"
            answer="DFT is the native token which fuels the DeFiat ecosystem. Anyone who holds the token is
              granted proportional ownership of the platform and has the right to vote accordingly within the
              governance of the platform. Holders can earn yield by staking the token in one of the
              pools offered through DeFiat Services."

            question="What are DeFiat Points v2 (DFTPv2)?"
            answer="DFTPv2 is the secondary token of the DeFiat ecosystem. One can earn DFTPv2 by transacting DFT
            on the open market, using AnyStake, or voting within the governance of the platform. DFTPv2 benefits users by giving discount levels at certain thresholds
            of interaction. Users can achieve discounts rate on future transaction and burn fees."

            question="What is DeFiat Governance?"
            answer="Governance can be seen as a democratic way to decide in which direction the platform should
          be heading. DeFiat Governance aims to create a community-based DeFi ecosystem where role's
          are voted on and empowered through economic incentives. The outcome of these decisions are
          all in the hands of the community."

            question="What are the three levels of DeFiat's Governance?"
            answer="To decide the direction of the platform just as in any governance in the real world it needs
          leaders. These leaders are chosen by the people, which in our case are the users of the
          platform. These leaders can also be voted out for again, so no monopoly can ever be created.
          DeFiat believes strongly in the strength of the users voting power."

            question="How do I purchase DeFiat (DFT) Tokens?"
